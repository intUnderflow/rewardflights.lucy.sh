# Multi-city reward planning — scope + design spec

Status: LEVEL 1 SHIPPED (2026-07-21). The chain engine (`resolveRoutings`,
`chainBits`, `focusLegs`) and the Level 1 smart-search UI are live: searching
a pair with no direct route (BLL→TYO) resolves through the hub and renders a
via-trip calendar with per-leg booking. This document records the feasibility
findings and the design decisions the adversarial review forced.

Motivating user story: living in Denmark, an award trip to Tokyo is really
Billund→London→Tokyo — two separate redemptions. Today the site treats
BLL→TYO as "no route". The goal: searching BLL→TYO should be smart enough to
work out the routing itself.

## Feasibility verdict: YES, at zero bundle cost

Multi-city is a **client-side query over data we already ship**. Measured on the
live bundle:

- The route graph is a **star centered on London**: 173 places, 356 routes,
  average out-degree 2.1. LON's out-degree is 172 (universal hub); BLL's is 1
  (LON only). Every spoke→spoke journey is spoke→LON→spoke.
- `store.destsByOrigin` (built at adoption) IS the adjacency graph.
- `roundTripBits` was already a 2-leg chain evaluator; the generalization adds
  ~50 lines of dormant JS and **zero bytes of data**. No processor change, no
  format change, no new fetches.

## Engine (shipped, dormant)

Two primitives in `site/app.js`, directly after `roundTripBits`:

- `resolveRoutings(o, d, {maxStops})` — concrete routings that exist in the
  data: the direct route first, then any one-stop o→H→d. On the star graph this
  is O(out-degree); for a spoke city it returns exactly `[[o,"LON",d]]`.
  Deliberately data-driven, not hardcoded to LON — the fixture's ANU→SKB edge
  already exercises a non-London hub, and future non-star data needs no change.
- `chainBits(path, mask, gaps, pax, focus)` — per-departure-day cabin mask for
  completing the whole itinerary. `gaps` is one `[min,max]` day-window per
  junction, so connection-vs-stopover is expressed per stop:

  ```js
  // Billund→Tokyo return in Club: ≤1-day connections at LON, 7–14 nights in
  // Tokyo, Club coupled across BOTH long-haul legs (legs 1 and 2), hops free:
  chainBits(["BLL","LON","TYO","LON","BLL"], 4, [[0,1],[7,14],[0,1]], pax, [1,2])
  ```

  **`focus` is the load-bearing design decision** (forced by two rounds of
  adversarial review). Chain legs are separate redemptions, so the cabin
  filter must not couple every leg the way `roundTripBits` couples a
  single-ticket round trip: measured, BLL-LON has **0** premium-economy days
  while LON-TYO has **112** — an all-coupled W search from Billund is empty
  forever, while the shipped semantics find 73 full-round-trip W days on the
  same data. Round two caught the overshoot: a single focus leg would light
  "Club" days whose return long-haul was Economy-only. So `focus` is an
  ARRAY of leg indices: those legs couple to one shared cabin (a "Club" trip
  means Club on both long legs), every other leg needs award space in ANY
  cabin for the same party. `focusLegs(path)` picks them: every leg at least
  half as long (great-circle, from the places' `g` coords) as the longest.
  The result's bits are the focus legs' shared cabins, keyed by first-leg
  departure day. `focus = null` couples ALL legs — with path `[A,B,A]`, gaps
  `[[m,M]]` that is *provably* `roundTripBits(A-B, B-A, mask, m, M)`, the
  cross-check anchoring the engine to shipped code.

  Backward pass, one rule for every leg: a focus leg ANDs its masked cabins
  into the payload; a non-focus leg gates on any-space and passes the payload
  through (seeded at "every cabin" when no focus leg follows). O(legs × days
  × window). pax>1 thresholds every leg with seats data and falls back to
  presence elsewhere; the VIEWS apply pax only when every leg has the seats
  layer (`chainSeatsKnown`), same one-consistent-threshold stance as the
  direct pages.

Tests: `mctest.js` (harness dir) — 34 engine checks in the real minified build
against the `data-out-test` fixture: routing resolution, every chain shape
cross-checked against an independent per-bit brute-force reference (coupled,
single-focus, dual-focus; pax 1 and 4; one-way and 4-leg), equality with
`roundTripBits`, zero-gap connection ≡ AND of legs, the coupled-W-empty vs
focus-W-nonzero asymmetry, monotonicity (coupled ⊆ focus, more focus legs ⊆
fewer, full trip ⊆ opener, pax 4 ⊆ pax 1), `focusLegs` picks, and all-zeros on
every malformed input. `viatest.js` — 30 UI checks (below).

## Honesty caveat (must surface in the UI)

The data is day-granular: it can say two legs have award space on given days,
never that an arrival beats a departure. **The overnight-stop rule (owner
decision, 2026-07-21) resolves this:** every hub junction has a hard 1-night
floor (`conn` = 1..3 nights, default 1; no same-day option anywhere — site,
engine, or server), because any arrival today makes any departure tomorrow
bookable. Residual caveat the via note still carries: a long-haul FIRST leg
can itself land the next calendar day. Same point-in-time honesty stance as
the footer.

## Booking reality (investigated 2026-07-21)

BA does **not** support multi-city award booking online at all — it is
phone-only (£15 offline fee, waived for Gold), per ThriftyPoints and
AwardWallet. Consequently there is no multi-city `_gf` deep-link to build, and
none is needed: each leg is its own redemption, so the UI links each leg
through the existing `baBookingURL` (point-to-point `_gf` deep-link) — "Book
BLL→LON on 3 Oct", "Book LON→TYO on 4 Oct". Separate tickets also sidestep
the missed-connection/protection question by making it explicit: these are
independent bookings, and the UI should say so.

## Feature ladder

1. **Smart search — SHIPPED.** The user's own framing: "searching BLL→TYO
   should be smart enough to work out how to search for this properly."
   - Home search: destinations reachable in one stop are pickable
     (`reachableDests`); via pairs get no sparkline (a wrong shape is worse
     than none). Picking lands on the normal `/trip/O-D` URL.
   - `/trip/O-D` and `/route/O-D` with no direct route resolve a hub that
     works in the needed direction(s) (`viaHub`) and render the via calendar:
     "via London" badge, honesty note (separate bookings; dates matched on
     award space, not flight times), stop-length control (1 / ≤2 / ≤3
     nights at the hub — `?conn=`, default 1 night; overnight floor by design), trip-length +
     party controls as on direct pages, cabin chips recounted from the chain
     with the filter on the long-haul legs, unreleased-horizon cards.
   - Day panel: outbound legs as separate rows with per-leg BA deep links
     (BA can't book multi-city awards online), a date chooser when the
     connection window allows two long-haul days, return days as radio rows
     (nights measured from the long-haul departure), hop-home dates included,
     and a cabin line naming what's open on both long legs. Picks pin to
     `?out=`/`?ret=` and restore on load, as on direct trips.
   - Alert bell on via pages saves chain watches (`via` + `conn` on the
     wire; no party row — hop routes carry no seat data). Direct routes are
     untouched — the via path only activates where the empty state used to
     be.

   *Level 1.5 (cheap follow-on, not built):* when a direct route exists but
   the filtered view is empty, also offer the via-hub alternative —
   `resolveRoutings` already returns both, direct first.
2. **Explicit multi-city builder.** User-composed N-leg itineraries with
   per-junction stopover windows and a chosen focus leg (the engine already
   takes both). Only worth building if Level 1 sees use.
3. **Full graph routing (NOT recommended).** Dijkstra-style multi-hub search.
   The star topology makes it pointless today: every pair is already reachable
   in ≤1 stop through LON.

**Alerts on chains — SHIPPED (2026-07-21).** The watch model grew `via` +
`conn`, the server detection engine evaluates whole chains (the leg-gains
theorem generalizes: a chain is newly bookable iff bookable now AND ≥1 leg
gained — where a hop leg "gains" only on no-space → some-space), and the bell
is live on via pages. See ALERTS-SPEC "Via (chain) watches".
